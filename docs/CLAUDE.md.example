# Example CLAUDE.md Addition

Add this section to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file to enable DocMeta integration:

## Documentation

This project uses [DocMeta](https://github.com/anthropic-community/docmeta) for AI-assisted code understanding. DocMeta provides structured metadata that helps AI coding agents like Claude Code understand your codebase faster than reading raw source files.

### Before working on code

Check if the target folder has a `.docmeta.json` file. If it does, read it first to understand:
- What the folder/files do (`purpose`)
- What will break if you change them (`usedBy` for imports, `calledBy` for HTTP calls)
- Recent context (`history`)

### After modifying code

Update `.docmeta.json` in any folder you changed:
- Update `exports` if you changed the public interface
- Update `uses` if you added/removed imports
- Run `docmeta usedby` to rebuild import dependencies
- Run `docmeta calls` to rebuild HTTP API dependencies (for Next.js/API routes)
- Add a `history` entry describing what you changed
- Update the `updated` timestamp

See `/docs/DOCMETA.md` for complete instructions.

## Quick Setup

1. Copy `docs/DOCMETA.md` from the docmeta package to your project
2. Add the above section to your `CLAUDE.md`
3. Claude Code will now read and maintain documentation automatically
